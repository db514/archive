To embedd dlls into exe

Install the Costura.Fody NuGet package and update the Fody NuGet package:

PM> Install-Package Fody
PM> Install-Package Costura.Fody

The Install-Package Fody is required since NuGet always defaults to the oldest, and most buggy, version of any dependency.


How it works
Merge assemblies as embedded resources

This approach uses a combination of two methods

    Jeffrey Richter's suggestion of using embedded resources as a method of merging assemblies
    Einar Egilsson's suggestion using cecil to create module initializers

Details

This Task performs the following changes

    Take all assemblies (and pdbs) that have been marked as "Copy Local" and embed them as resources in the target assembly.
    Injects the following code into the module initializer of the target assembly. This code will be called when the assembly is loaded into memory

eg

static <Module>()
{
    ILTemplate.Attach();
}

    Injects the following class into the target assembly. This means if an assembly load fails it will be loaded from the embedded resources.
        ILTemplate.cs
        ILTemplateWithTempAssembly.cs
